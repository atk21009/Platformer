# Platformer

The game I developed is a 2D platformer game in where the user controls one character and the goal is to get to the bottom of the level and retrieve the gem while dodging spikes and turrets.

The purpose for writing this software was to get an initial look on how to develop games. I don't have too mmuch experience in game design, level design or asset design. However, I wanted to learn the basics of game design and try to create a somewhat simple game.

# Development Environment

{Describe the tools that you used to develop the software}
The main tool that I used for this game development was Unreal Engine 5. It creates a great enviorment for learning how to design levels and gettting a good introduction into all aspects of game design.

{Describe the programming language that you used and any libraries.}
The main form of coding that I used was Unreal Engine 5 Blueprint library. In which I used Blueprint to create functionalitity to the game by giving assets movement, speed, jumping, timing and various other features.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- Creating more levels to the game. Currently I only have one level to the game because I wasn't too sure how to create or design levels so the initial level took a lot longer than I expected
- Learn how to design assets. A lot of my assets I was able to find online for free, and are great for learning how to get started. However, in the future I want to learn how to design assets of my own and learn how to create them myself.
- Create a 3D game. While creating a 2D game with all the functionality was difficult I would really like to learn and dive deeper on creating a 3D game and learn how assets work in that realm.
