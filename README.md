# Platformer

The game I developed is a 2D platformer game in which the user controls one character and aims to get to the bottom of the level and retrieve the gem while dodging spikes and turrets.

The purpose of writing this software was to get an initial look at how to develop games. I don't have too much experience in game design, level design, or asset design. However, I wanted to learn game design basics and try to create a somewhat simple game.

# Development Environment

The main tool that I used for this game development was Unreal Engine 5. It creates an excellent environment for learning how to design levels and getting a good introduction to all aspects of game design.

The main form of coding that I used was Unreal Engine 5 Blueprint library. I used Blueprint to create functionality for the game by giving assets movement, speed, jumping, timing, and various other features.

# Future Work

- Creating more levels for the game. Currently, I only have one level in the game because I wasn't too sure how to create or design levels so the initial level took a lot longer than I expected
- Learn how to design assets. A lot of my assets I was able to find online for free, and they are great for learning how to get started. However, in the future, I want to learn how to design assets of my own and learn how to create them myself.
- Create a 3D game. While creating a 2D game with all the functionality was difficult I would like to learn and dive deeper into creating a 3D game and learn how assets work in that realm.
